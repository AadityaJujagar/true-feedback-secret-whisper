## 🎯 About

Secret Whisper is a modern web platform that enables users to build their digital profiles and receive real-time feedback from the community. Whether it's constructive criticism, appreciation, or suggestions, Secret Whisper provides a safe and organized space for meaningful interactions.

Each user gets a shareable profile link where others can leave comments—without identity constraints. Comments can be toggled visible/hidden, giving profile owners full control over what's displayed.
